YOLOv5 ðŸš€ is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.


See the YOLOv5 Docs for full documentation on training, testing and deployment.

Quick Start Examples
Install
Clone repo and install requirements.txt in a Python>=3.7.0 environment, including PyTorch>=1.7.

git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt  # install
Inference
YOLOv5 PyTorch Hub inference. Models download automatically from the latest YOLOv5 release.

import torch

# Model
model = torch.hub.load('ultralytics/yolov5', 'yolov5s')  # or yolov5n - yolov5x6, custom

# Images
img = 'https://ultralytics.com/images/zidane.jpg'  # or file, Path, PIL, OpenCV, numpy, list

# Inference
results = model(img)

# Results
results.print()  # or .show(), .save(), .crop(), .pandas(), etc.

Yolo V5 Architecture
CNN-based Object Detectors are primarily applicable for recommendation systems. YOLO (You Only Look Once) models are used for Object detection with high performance. YOLO divides an image into a grid system, and each grid detects objects within itself. They can be used for real-time object detection based on the data streams. They require very few computational resources.
